Node.JS Blockchain Challenge
============================

Challenge
---------

Parking passes are usually a QR-code representation of a string value. Our forward-thinking
client would like us to generate barcodes for them, using blockchain, to distribute to
customers. Weâ€™d like you to write a Node.js script that hashes

* a pseudo-random 12-16 character alphanumeric string,
* the timestamp,
* the company name,
* and the previous hash value

and then appends that string value to a blockchain. The following criteria will be used to
evaluate the product in rough order of priority:

1. Was the script written in such a way as to be concise and efficient without sacrificing
readability?
2. Are the methods that you use to generate the string thoughtful and meet the outlined
criteria?
3. Does it have testing so that we can verify it works as intended?
4. Has it been commented so that another developer can clearly understand how it
functions and why you made the decisions you made?
5. Would the script be reusable in different platforms or contexts?
6. Does the script run?

Testing
-------

`$ npm run test`
